A spin-off of the skills work I'm doing for ultimateSpartan's 'Quest' mod, this is a stand-alone sword fighting
package that will give your Minecraft combat a very familiar feel, at least if you've played any of the Zelda games.

Press 'x' while looking at a target to lock on; once locked on, you will be able to use a variety of skills as you
learn them using the arrow keys. RCtrl blocks, tab switches targets. Some skills only require the key to be tapped;
other skills require the key to be held down for some time to charge up, and still other skills have even more unique
activation methods.

Skills are learned from orbs that drop rarely from mobs - some mobs have a higher rate of dropping a certain type of
skill orb, so be on the lookout for them! Each skill can gain multiple levels, each level increasing your damage, range,
or other factor, as well as granting you an extra 1/2 heart of health. Some mobs drop heart orbs as well.

After you've learned the first level of the skill from an orb, if you get a second orb you will be able to see information
about the skill in the tooltip that will give you hints on how to activate it, if you hadn't figured it out already.
